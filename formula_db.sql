We’ve got great targets ahead of us.\r\n\r\n“Red Bull, it’s a team that really takes everything out of you – it’s something that, since I came here, the amount of how intense everything is, on track, off track… It’s a challenge you don’t have anywhere else.', 'perez.jpg', 'f1', 1),

(20, 'F1 2026 regulations officially unveiled with new-look car of the future', 'The FIA has officially unveiled the highly-anticipated F1 2026 regulations, with the Formula 1 cars of the future now given their set parameters to work under.', 'Much has already been made of the push towards additional sustainability with the new regulations, with the power units set to treble the current power generated by electrical energy, which will create an even split between electric and internal combustion power.\r\n\r\nNew manufacturers will join the grid in Audi, who will be completing a full takeover of the Sauber team by the time 2026 begins, and Honda will become factory partners of Aston Martin after their current working relationship ends with Red Bull, who will begin making their own power units in conjunction with Ford.\r\n\r\nIn total, a record six power unit manufacturers – Honda, Red Bull Ford Powertrains, Ferrari, Mercedes, Renault and Audi – will be competing in F1 2026.\r\n\r\nFIA single seater director Nikolas Tombazis revealed that the element of ‘raceability’ introduced in F1 2022 will continue in F1 2026, with the aim of allowing the drivers to race as close together as possible. Among the key takeaways is that the cars are lighter, shorter and narrower than before – with 30 kilograms knocked off the current minimum weight, taking that down to 768kg.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the cars will be reduced in size, with the wheelbase 200mm shorter (down from 3600mm to 3400mm) and 100mm narrower (1900mm, down from 2000mm) than their current size, with the FIA aiming to make a more ‘nimble’ car moving forward.\r\n\r\nActive aerodynamics had also been mooted, and this will be the case. DRS will no longer be an overtaking aid, but the FIA confirmed the movable rear wing will instead open automatically on straights so as to reduce drag at each possible opportunity, with more moving parts in the rear wing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new part will be the addition of active front wings, which will have moving parts in the same way as DRS to suit the energy demands of the new power units, which will be powered by fully sustainable fuel.\r\n\r\nAn all-new ‘Manual Override Mode’ in cars will allow the drivers more electrical power deployment while they are following another car, in a boost to overtaking credentials.\r\n\r\nSafety has remained a consideration throughout the process, with the FIA confirming that even tougher safety tests are in place on the F1 2026 cars and stronger structures are in place on the cars.\r\n\r\nFIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said: “Today, the FIA is defining a hugely exciting future for the pinnacle of motorsport with the launch of a comprehensive new set of regulations for the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship and beyond.\r\n\r\n“Following the publication of 2026 Power Unit Regulations two years ago we have taken the opportunity to redefine the chassis regulations to match the energy requirement of the new power units.\r\n\r\n“Collaborating with our partners at Formula 1 and with the assistance of the sport’s 10 teams and all our stakeholders this represents a unique revision that will ensure our premier championship is even more relevant to what is happening in the world.\r\n\r\n“The Power Unit Regulations have already resulted in a record number of PU manufacturers committing to the sport. And now, in tandem with chassis regulations that provide for lighter, more agile cars featuring innovative aerodynamic solutions, we have created a set of regulations designed to not only improve racing but also to make the championship even more attractive to PU manufacturers, OEMs and existing competitors.\r\n\r\n“The key features of the 2026 F1 Regulations are advanced, sustainability technology and safety. Our aim, together with Formula 1, was to produce a car that was right for the future of the sport’s elite category. We believe we have achieved that goal.”\r\n\r\nFormula 1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali said: “These regulations mark a significant moment in the future of our sport as we look forward to a new generation of car and power unit that aims to give our fans closer and exciting racing.\r\n\r\n“The new sustainably fuelled hybrid power unit presents a huge opportunity for the global automotive industry, the drop in fuel has the potential to be used by cars around the world and dramatically cut emissions.\r\n\r\n“Its potential is one of the key reasons why we will have a record number of engine suppliers in Formula 1 in 2026.\r\n\r\n“We enter this new regulatory cycle with the sport in the strongest position it has ever been, and I am confident that the work done by the FIA to create these regulations will further strengthen the position of the sport around the world.”\r\n\r\nNikolas Tombazis, the FIA’s single-seater technical director, added: “With this set of regulations the FIA has sought to develop a new generation of cars that are fully in touch with the DNA of Formula 1 – cars that are light, supremely fast and agile but which also remains at the cutting edge of technology, and to achieve this we worked towards what we called a ‘nimble car’ concept.\r\n\r\n“At the centre of that vision is a redesigned power unit that features a more even split between the power derived from the internal combustion element and electrical power.\r\n\r\n“On the chassis side we have managed to reduce the size and weight of the car by 30kg resulting in a much more dynamic car.\r\n\r\n“In addition we are introducing two exciting new features to enhance racing – active aerodynamics to achieve very low drag on the straights and the Manual Override system that will provide drivers with an on-demand burst of battery power when close enough to the car ahead of them.\r\n\r\n“Lighter, more powerful and more focused on driver skill, the 2026 FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations have been designed to provide closer racing among drivers, increase the competition between teams and improve the spectacle.\r\n\r\n“In addition, we have opted for a higher electrical component of the power unit, a more efficient car overall, and fully sustainable fuels, as part of our drive towards a more sustainable future for our sport.”', '2026-Car-Render-7.jpg', 'f1', 1),

First, Joshua Duerksen finished third in Imola before Taylor Barnard won the Monte Carlo Sprint Race.\r\n\r\nThose results lift the team onto 25 points and while they are still at the bottom of the Championship, Senior Team Member Morne Reinecke is pleased with their progress. He says that it is all part of the “solid foundations” they are laying to become a front running outfit. “To say we are pleased would be a massive understatement,” said Reinecke. “The step forward since testing is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire team, who have worked long hours to make sure we can give our drivers a competitive package. So, I want to thank each of them for their selfless dedication to ensure that we are heading in the right direction.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we all know that change does not happen overnight. However, with the constant effort, we will reach our goal of being among the front runners in both F2 & F3.”\r\n\r\nDuerksen’s podium came on a weekend in which the Paraguayan driver had qualified in fifth place, three-tenths off Invicta Racing’s pole-sitter Gabriel Bortoleto. After being involved in an opening lap collision in the Sprint, he returned on Sunday to put in an assured performance in the Feature, running a solid race to P3, giving both he and the team their first points and podium in Formula 2.\r\n\r\nIt was then Barnard’s turn in Monte Carlo, starting on reverse grid pole and enduring a late Red Flag and challenge from Bortoleto to win the Sprint Race.\r\n\r\nLooking at their performances over those two race weekends, Reinecke says it has been an emotional time for the team given all their hard work to ensure they could compete for those top positions.\r\n\r\nBortoleto: ‘Special’ connection with Invicta gives confidence for the rest of the season\r\n\r\n“Our entire team were incredibly emotional along with Joshua after his podium finish in Imola,” he admitted. “When you put everything together on race day and obtain such a phenomenal result it really brings out significant emotions.\r\n\r\n“With the team that we have and with Joshua’s focus, we believe that this is just the first of many podiums for him and this team.\r\n\r\n“We were also extremely pleased for both the team and for Taylor because it was such a stellar performance in Monaco. Our hard work and dedication are truly paying off and it is an example of the strategy and work ethic our partners AIX have brought to the team.\r\n\r\n“But it truly is a team effort and again I have to thank every member of the team behind the scenes for making sure this machine works.” Elaborating on the two drivers’ performances so far this season, Reinecke continued: “We have been really impressed by the professionalism of both drivers, both on and off the track.\r\n\r\n“It’s so easy to forget that they are still rookies, but their approach and feedback from a technical perspective and from a feeling within the car is astounding. We are so fortunate to have Joshua and Taylor and we are grateful to be able to grow this team with them.”\r\n\r\nThey will now be hoping to build on those two race weekends starting in Barcelona, which kicks off a triple header that will also see the teams head to Spielberg and Silverstone.\r\n\r\nHubert: DAMS Lucas Oil focused on top five goal this season\r\n\r\nWhen asked what he would like to achieve at the next three weekends and the rest of the season, Reinecke was taking a long-term view, with his eyes set on turning AIX into a stronger contender over the course of the season.\r\n\r\n“Each department within our team has clearly defined goals, and we are focused on meeting objectives one at a time,” he explained. “As I mentioned earlier, of course we want to be a front-running team, but we are realistic, and we know that takes time.\r\n\r\n“So, we are putting everything in place to build a solid foundation and hopefully that will serve us well and help us achieve our goal of becoming a front-running team.” ', 'aix.jpg', 'f2', 1),

It’s my home, where I grew up and where all of my family is. I always feel comfortable there and have my friends and sponsors supporting me. I really miss home when I’m racing during the year. I don’t get to go home much now because I’m really busy with racing, so every year I have less and less time to go. It’s also quite a long flight and pretty expensive to go back.”\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE OF MOTORSPORT, WHICH ATHLETE DO YOU ADMIRE THE MOST?\r\n\r\n“I have a few. I really admire Lionel Messi of course, I respect him as a person and athlete. He’s a great person, very humble and for the amount of success he’s had, it’s quite impressive. In terms of others, there are quite a few triathletes I admire and follow a lot. But mostly Messi with me being from Argentina, that’s the obvious one.”\r\n\r\nWHO DO YOU KNOW BEST ON THE GRID?\r\n\r\n“I don’t know actually. I know Victor quite well. I’ve raced against him back in Formula Renault. I’ve raced against Victor quite a bit since I was young. He was always two years ahead being older, but when I was a rookie, I always got to race against him. He’s the one I’ve raced the most on the grid.” WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE CHEAT MEAL?\r\n\r\n“It depends on the mood, depends on the moment, or how much salty or sweet food I’ve had. If I’ve had too much sweetness, then I’d go the other way. Like an ice cream, I love chocolate. Or dulce de leche, it’s like caramel but from Argentina, it’s much, much better. I really love that and miss it so much during the year. In Spain there’s some, but it’s a thing from Argentina so when I’m back there and at home, I love it.”\r\n\r\nIF YOU COULD GO BACK TO RELIVE A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?\r\n\r\n“Well I think the best moment so far in my career was in Abu Dhabi when I drove the Formula 1 car with Williams last year. I would love to go back and have another go, that’s what I’m working towards this year. That’s what the target is. The focus is on Formula 2 this year, but I want to get back into that car.” WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE MOVIE OR TV SHOW?\r\n\r\n“I really like this show from Argentina, translated it’s called ‘The Boss’. I’ve just finished watching that and it’s really fun, the guy is a genius. I finished it not long ago.”\r\n\r\nWHAT WAS THE LAST SONG YOU LISTENED TO?\r\n\r\n“My Spotify is full of Spanish songs, that’s what I usually listen to. I like music in English but I’m a guy that prefers Spanish music.” WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE RACING MEMORY?\r\n\r\n“Definitely driving the Williams. I have plenty of favourite moments so far in my racing career but since that moment, that Formula 1 test is the best. It was an amazing moment, what I’d dreamt of since I was really young. To have that opportunity in my first year with Williams was an amazing experience.\r\n\r\n“There are many things that they tell you about it being really fast, really efficient on the brakes, really hard on the neck, and you’re like ‘yeah, but it’s a car’ but you don’t realise it until you drive it. Once you’re in the car, you realise how fast and how physical it is, how much downforce it has and how efficient everything is. Until you drive it, you can’t understand.”\r\n\r\nWHAT IS YOUR MOST TREASURED POSSESSION?\r\n\r\n“My family. From all the things that I have, that’s the most precious thing that I have.”\r\nWHAT’S THE BEST PIECE OF ADVICE YOU’VE EVER BEEN GIVEN?\r\n\r\n“I’ve been given a lot of advice and I’ve had some tough moments in my career in motorsport. I’ve got some people that I really trust and have confidence in that have given me advice that I’ve followed, so I think the main one I always think of is the right one to think about and work on is to take risks and live for your dream, whatever it costs and try to achieve it. If you give it your all and it doesn’t turn out the way you want, you’re still going to be satisfied and you’re not going to feel an empty space that you didn’t try everything. So to give my maximum, that’s what I always do and would be the advice I would give.”\r\n\r\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PLACE YOU’VE BEEN TO AND ONE YOU’D LIKE TO VISIT?\r\n\r\n“I visited New Zealand some time ago, I love it there, it’s a very cool country and not many people have the possibility to go with it being so far away. It’s a pretty unique place to go to. I really enjoyed it there. I raced in a championship there and that was really cool.\r\n\r\n“I would love to go to somewhere in Africa.

(24, 'Consistency now the goal for Meguetounif after ‘special’ first win in Imola', 'Sami Meguetounif has made an impressive start to life in Formula 3, including taking a maiden victory at Imola last month.', 'The Frenchman made a strong start by scoring points in both Sakhir races, including a P4 in the Feature. However, that was followed by a difficult weekend in Melbourne, where a crash in Qualifying saw him leave without a point.\r\n\r\nHe then achieved his first F3 victory with a stellar performance in the Imola Feature Race after qualifying third behind his teammates. But a week later he left Monte Carlo without scoring a point, having suffered contact that forced him onto the sidelines of Sunday’s 27-lap event. As he reflected on his season so far, Meguetounif says that even though things have been a “bit up and down” the potential for more is clearly there.\r\n\r\n“I think we have shown our potential since the beginning,” the Frenchman declared. “We had a lot of positives in Bahrain, I think my first weekend was quite good as a rookie, I managed to do a good quali, putting together what I learned in the test and a decent result in the Feature Race, finishing fourth, so it was quite good and I was happy with that one.\r\n\r\n“I think in Melbourne, it was a big mistake on my side, the potential was as good as Bahrain, even more maybe, but I just maybe asked too much from the car compared to what was possible and maybe took too much risk. So, Melbourne was a big down and a big mistake, but I learned a lot from it. “We managed to bounce back in Imola, which was great for the team as well, we scored good points, we did a great Quali and managed to win the race and it was a very nice moment for me personally.”\r\n\r\nLooking back on that weekend in Imola, Meguetounif admitted that because they had to prepare for Monte Carlo almost immediately, he did not get a lot of time to realise and enjoy what he had achieved.\r\n\r\nBut as he analysed the race, he admitted how “proud” he was with how he handled the situations, calling his performance “mature” and “smooth”, which makes is accomplishment all the more special. “In the Sprint Race I had an incident, something that was difficult to avoid with Dino Beganovic and it was a shame because the race was great,” he said. “I took all the good decisions at the start of the race to gain positions and I felt how quick I was compared to the others.\r\n\r\n“We were really disappointed Saturday night but at the same time I could see how quick I was, and I had gotten a first feeling of what was going to happen on Sunday. On Sunday after doing a good start with my teammates, we managed to keep our positions.\r\n\r\n“I decided to focus on my rhythm and my feeling within the car and really look after my tyres without getting stressed by the pressure I had behind from Lindblad. But I was just entering the very first part of the race driving clean, driving smooth and I knew it was going to pay off if the race was going like that without a Safety Car.\r\n\r\n“I was right because there was no Safety Car and I think from mid-race it started to pay off. If you take Ollie Goethe, he had to push a lot at the start to gain positions because he was starting in P7, and I think from mid race I think he was starting to struggle more lap after lap. “For me I could just increase the pace and from then on, I was in another rhythm. As a rookie I am really proud of this one.”\r\n\r\nJoining him on the podium that day was his teammate Leonardo Fornaroli, who finished third. Meguetounif says working with the Italian has been a “big help”, as he has been fast from the start of the season, giving him a great reference.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman says he has a “good relationship” with Fornaroli, who has finished in the points in seven of the opening eight races and currently sits third in the Drivers’ Standings on 64 points.\r\n\r\nA slice of serenity outside of the city: Tim Tramnitz on his hometown and Hamburg\r\n\r\nMeguetounif is looking to emulate Fornaroli’s consistency for the rest of the season in the hopes of helping Trident overhaul the 55-point gap to PREMA Racing for top spot in the Teams’ Standings.\r\n\r\nIn terms of his own personal goals though, Meguetounif said:” I think it\'s very early to talk about any Drivers’ Championship. I think the only thing I have to be focused on is doing my job now in the right way.\r\n\r\n“I don\'t need to prove to anyone that I am fast, I know that if I just do my job in the right way, and do less mistakes, I know that with the pace we have and with the circuits that I know from now on, I know that the victories and podiums will come to me.\r\n\r\n“We don\'t approach the race weekends thinking about winning or a podium, we focus on doing the best job and in the end by doing that the win comes to you like in Imola. So, when I say consistency, it means do less mistakes, finish all the races, get the right approach in every session, in Quali and for sure then I will not be scared of talking about a Championship.\r\n\r\n“But my energy is not going to that way. It\'s just putting things together and we will see where we end up. So, to win on my third Feature Race in F3, being a rookie, I\'m the only one that has done it so far, I think now it\'s a matter of repeating the same kind of job, and if it\'s not P1, it\'s P2, or P3 but I want this more often, that\'s the main goal.”', 'ffghfgh.jpg', 'f3', 1),

We were just trying to cool the tyres, then trying to push and do the same thing all over again in the beginning especially.\r\n\r\n“Then the rest of the race was just saving tyres for some doors that might open in the end of the race. Unfortunately, we had to save the car in the end, so we couldn\'t really do anything about it. But we’ll take the points.\r\n\r\nMONTE CARLO ANALYSIS: Hitech’s out-of-the-box thinking in Qualifying a growing trend\r\n\r\n“It\'s not the weekend we wanted or expected, and the speed was definitely there for much more. In Qualifying, getting that Red Flag just metres before the line was tough, and it just compromised the rest of the weekend.\r\n\r\n“But I think taking these points with P6, P7 and fastest lap on Saturday will play a big part in the Championship at the end of the year. So, it\'s been a tough and disappointing weekend, but I think it\'s very important for the Championship.”\r\n\r\nWith four race weekends in the books and a very busy period in the calendar commencing with Round 5 in Barcelona, Beganovic says that every point earned from here on in will be crucial. The PREMA driver says that the team are now looking to maximise whatever situation they find themselves in, as they did in Monaco despite having the pace for Pole and victory.\r\n\r\n“The focus is just to do everything that we can in the situation we are in, for example, at Imola, we didn\'t really have the right feeling with the car, and we were just not fast enough, so we just took the points and moved forward.\r\n\r\n“So, we will do it again from here. The feeling has been much better here in Monaco, but other things went wrong. We will take it, but we are always looking at the big picture, always scoring the points needed and we will also look to fight for podiums, Pole Positions and wins in the in the next few races. It will be very busy in June and July.”\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: What We Learned: The key talking points from our weekend in Monte Carlo\r\n\r\nWith eyes focused forward on Barcelona, the Ferrari Academy driver says he will be aiming to right the wrongs from Monte Carlo and put together a lap good enough to fight for the higher places on the grid.\r\n\r\nFrom there, he believes the team have more than enough pace to fight for the bigger points on offer, but added he expects tough opposition from two teams in particular after their strong showings during in-season testing in April.\r\n\r\n“Considering we had a good feeling here in Monaco, coming into June and July, it gives a bit of a boost definitely. Also, it\'s a track that everybody knows so it will be very tight in Qualifying. It will be very important to put the lap together and not make any mistakes to always be there.\r\n\r\n“As I said everybody will be faster, no doubt. The margins will be much less, but I feel good. We were strong there looking at the test in Qualifying and race run, so I\'m feeling good, let\'s see. Campos looked very strong there Trident also, but we\'re confident heading into the triple-header.”', 'dinobeg.jpg', 'f3', 1),

He was then made to wait to see if his teammates Dino Beganovic and Arvid Lindblad as well Christian Mansell would beat his time.\r\n\r\nBut they could not and from then on, he managed things well in the Feature Race, dealing with three Safety Car restarts on his way to standing on the top step once more.\r\n\r\nThis also puts the Italian at the top of the Drivers’ Championship and after a slightly quiet but consistent start to the season, this victory could be the catalyst Minì was looking for heading into the next portion of the year.\r\n\r\nART FIGHTING AT THE FRONT\r\nIt was a particularly good weekend for ART Grand Prix who continue their fight back to the front after finishing seventh in last year’s Championship.\r\n\r\nThe weekend started well, with Mansell fastest in Group B, leaving him to start from second in the Feature Race while Nikola Tsolov and Laurens van Hoepen lined up on the front row in the Sprint.\r\n\r\nFEATURE RACE: Minì becomes eighth winner in 2024 with Monte Carlo victory\r\n\r\nTsolov made that reverse grid Pole count as he went on to seal his maiden Formula 3 victory, while van Hoepen crossed the line in P3, giving him his third Sprint Race podium of the season.\r\n\r\nMansell on the other hand pushed Minì all the way in the Feature but just could not make his way past the PREMA driver, leaving him to cross the line in second.\r\n\r\nIt’s the Australian’s second P2 result of the year, after the Sakhir Feature Race, and it lifts ART to third in the Teams’ Standings, tied with Campos Racing on 85 points.\r\n\r\nTheir 36 points scored in Monte Carlo was only bettered by Championship leaders PREMA and it should give the French outfit plenty of confidence going forward. RODIN GET OFF THE MARK\r\nComing into the weekend, Rodin Motorsport had been the only team in the paddock yet to score a point so far. However, speaking to the team, they were nothing if not extremely positive about their performances this year.\r\n\r\nMonte Carlo showed exactly why, with Joseph Loake, on his first visit to the Principality as a driver, qualifying in P8 – his best result of the season.\r\n\r\nLoake: Best F3 Qualifying result evidence of Rodin progress\r\n\r\nThis put the Briton in contention to score some good points across the weekend and he did exactly that, finishing fifth in the Sprint before taking the chequered flag in ninth place in the Feature Race.\r\n\r\nHe also made the highlight reel with a spectacular overtake at La Rascasse on the Campos of Mari Boya. While that would have made Loake and Rodin happy, they confirmed what they had been saying for a while which is that if they keep it clean, they can battle for points.\r\n\r\nIt also gives them a great platform for the rest of the season to achieve Team Manager Sam Waple’s target of points at every weekend.\r\nDRIVERS’ CHAMPIONSHIP HEATS UP\r\nFor the third time in four rounds, we have a new Drivers’ Championship leader as Minì’s pole position and victory in Monte Carlo put him on 72 points and at the top of the Standings.\r\n\r\nHe is now four points clear of Browning in second, who was the leader after the opening two rounds. Fornaroli, who was tied with the Hitech Pulse-Eight driver after Round 2 and at the top by himself heading to Monaco, is now in third place, eight points adrift of Minì.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: Luke Browning aiming for more Monaco points after brave opening lap moves in Sprint\r\n\r\nBehind them Beganovic is fourth, Lindblad’s in fifth and Oliver Goethe is sixth and not that far off the leader either, with the gap from Minì to 11th placed Boya at 42 points.\r\n\r\nThis means that one victory could put you right into the mix giving all of these drivers plenty of hope heading into the last six rounds and setting us up for an exciting end to the season.', 'sdfsdfsdf.jpg', 'f3', 1),
(54, 'Gasly reflects on his partnership with Ocon', 'Pierre Gasly has given his take on how his partnership with Esteban Ocon has played out at Alpine amid the news that Ocon will depart the squad at the end of 2024.', 'When Gasly joined the incumbent Ocon at the team in 2023, there was much speculation over how the previously tense relationship that had developed between the pair during their junior racing careers could have an impact. However, when asked prior to this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix to reflect on the kind of team mate that Ocon had been, Gasly spoke of how they had managed to work together in a professional manner at Alpine.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long story between Esteban and myself,” the Frenchman explained. “I think so far in the last year and a half, we’ve managed to work and cooperate very professionally, so I think this is important to mention.\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t always been easy, as you would imagine from two very competitive drivers, but considering the story between us I think it’s been good.” On whether Ocon’s impending exit from the team will have any effect on his own plans for 2025, Gasly responded: “To be honest, absolutely nothing. I think at the minute it’s quite clear the position I’m in, and for my future at the moment I have nothing really to announce. You guys will know in due time.”\r\n\r\nWhile there have been several key moves in the driver market across recent weeks and months, Gasly says that he has not set himself a deadline for deciding on his next steps.\r\n\r\n“I think the market at the moment is quite open and everybody is aware of what opportunities are out there,” he added. “At the moment I don’t really have too much detail on that. Everything is going well and I’m in discussions, and that’s about it.” It proved to be an eventful weekend for Alpine last time out in Monaco, with Ocon being handed a five-place grid drop for Canada after clashing with Gasly on the opening lap of the race. Ocon later apologised for the incident, while Gasly stated that a “clear instruction” from the team “wasn’t respected” by Ocon.\r\n\r\nPushed on whether any directives will be reinforced for the upcoming event in Montreal, Gasly remarked: “I think the directives were pretty clear in Monaco – unfortunately it’s not what happened on track, but I’m pretty confident moving forward that we won’t face any issues.”\r\n\r\nDespite the dramatic intra-team collision – which forced Ocon to retire from the race due to damage sustained to his A524 – Gasly went on to score his debut point of the season with a P10 result, having also made it into Q3 of qualifying for the first time in 2024. “It was pretty positive,” the 28-year-old said of his pace in Monte Carlo. “Our first Q3 of the year, [and we] managed to show some good speed throughout the whole qualifying.\r\n\r\n“Definitely some good signs, obviously we know Monaco is a kind of particular track, so we know we might not be in a similar position on all the tracks, but definitely some good signs.” In terms of whether his prospects might be similar at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, Gasly sounded a positive note whilst also acknowledging that the team still have work to do.\r\n\r\n“We know we’re still a bit on the back foot and we’re trying to rethink a bit how we want to approach this car concept,” he commented. “At the minute it’s mainly focusing on maximising what we’ve got, and we can see a lot can happen on race days.\r\n\r\n\"We’ll see, we’ll try again. We know we’re fighting for points right at the back of the top 10, but hopefully we can be in a position to repeat the performance of Monaco.”', 'ocon.jpg', 'f1', 1),
(55, 'Leclerc assesses title chances after Monaco', 'Charles Leclerc is keeping his feet on the ground after taking an emotional home victory at the Monaco Grand Prix', 'Leclerc’s win, along with team mate Carlos Sainz’s podium finish and Red Bull’s struggles in Monte Carlo, saw him slash Max Verstappen’s championship lead to 31 points at the one-third stage of the season. Ferrari, meanwhile, are now just 24 points adrift of Red Bull in the constructors’ standings, with Verstappen having to settle for P6 last time out and the other RB20 of Sergio Perez retiring on the first lap.\r\n\r\nSuch a significant points swing led Ferrari ambassador Marc Gene to argue that thoughts of a championship assault were now “unavoidable” for the Maranello outfit as the season wears on. Asked about those comments as the paddock reconvened in Montreal for this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix, Leclerc said: “I’m not thinking about the championship yet, but definitely the target is to be able to win races every weekend.\r\n\r\n“We are, I think, improving more than anybody else in the last seven, eight months, and we need to keep focusing on the process more than on the outcome. The good outcome will only be the result of hard work and work well done. “We are really focusing on the process, on our weaknesses, and how we can optimise every single aspect of the car. By doing just that we will get to the point where we are in contention [to] win every single weekend.\r\n\r\n“That’s of course the target, because as much as it felt really good in Monaco, now we need to turn the page and look at what’s ahead. We want to win the world championship, that’s the target, and for that we still have to do steps forward.”\r\n\r\nLeclerc’s win in Monte Carlo came amid an improved run of form that steadily took the early-season intra-team advantage away from Sainz, who had been leading Ferrari’s charge and won their first race of the year in Australia. “I think it’s always been the same between Charles and me,” said the Spaniard when asked about the battle between the pair. “He goes through very good patches of performance, I go through another good patch.\r\n\r\n“I think the important thing is that when he’s having a good race, I’m also having a good race and finishing P3. When I won in Australia, he finished second, and that’s what makes us such a strong team pairing.” He added: “That’s why we have so many points in the championship and we are even considering fighting Red Bull for the constructors’ [championship].\r\n\r\n“It’s great to see him win in Monaco, it was great to get the win in Australia, but the important thing is that we’re always there, pushing each other, being next to each other in qualifying and the race, and it’s a good situation to have.”', 'lecler.jpg', 'f1', 1),
